# Burgundy's Simple Serverless App - Amiibos - WIP

This is a basic app that currently pulls from `http://www.amiiboapi.com/api/amiibo/` and displays the amiibos.

* Searching for amiibos

## Improvments:

* Add tests

* Update how the application is hosted
* Group data into amiibos with the same name
* Add component to all variations of an amiibo on one page
* Add searching for amiibos
* Update how state is handled
* Pagination
* Format data
* display images
* Improve UX, making it responsive for mobile, tablet and destop
* Web accessible
* Implement translations properly for multilingual
